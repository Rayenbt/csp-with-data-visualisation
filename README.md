# CSP Visualization and Interactive GUI

This project tackles a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) involving assigning employees to roles based on their abilities and company vacancies. It provides clear visualizations and an interactive interface to explore different assignment scenarios.

Key aspects include:

- Visualizing role vacancies and employee skills using bar plots and heatmaps  
- Exploring assignment solutions interactively with Sankey diagrams  
- A GUI that lets users switch between scenarios and view visualizations in one place

The project aims to communicate complex CSP results in an accessible and interactive way.
